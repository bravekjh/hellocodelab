# Origin Story

## Origin Story
The beginnings of CodeLab started when Leigh (@leighphan) saw a need for a community welcoming beginning programmers serving the North Orange County and South Los Angeles County region of California. While there are established tech hubs and programming groups in Long Beach, San Diego, South Orange County, and Los Angeles, no known communities existed for our local community between LA and South OC.

Our first meeting was on the evening of August 1st, 2016 at Pro Desk Space, a coworking space in Downtown Fullerton -- CodeLab was born!

Today CodeLab is brought to you by @leighphan and Ashley (@kangashley) and [Pro Desk Space](http://prodeskspace.com/). We continue to grow in knowledge and community as part of the greater Southern California software community.
